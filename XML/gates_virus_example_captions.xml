<transcript><text start="17.504" dur="1.894">When I was a kid,</text><text start="19.398" dur="3.561">the disaster we worried about most 
was a nuclear war.</text><text start="23.819" dur="3.266">That&amp;#39;s why we had a barrel like this
down in our basement,</text><text start="27.085" dur="2.571">filled with cans of food and water.</text><text start="30.256" dur="1.645">When the nuclear attack came,</text><text start="31.901" dur="4.736">we were supposed to go downstairs,
hunker down, and eat out of that barrel.</text><text start="37.877" dur="3.72">Today the greatest risk 
of global catastrophe</text><text start="41.597" dur="2.86">doesn&amp;#39;t look like this.</text><text start="44.457" dur="2.781">Instead, it looks like this.</text><text start="48.438" dur="5.491">If anything kills over 10 million people
in the next few decades,</text><text start="53.929" dur="3.385">it&amp;#39;s most likely to be 
a highly infectious virus</text><text start="57.314" dur="2.478">rather than a war.</text><text start="59.792" dur="3.887">Not missiles, but microbes.</text><text start="63.679" dur="2.199">Now, part of the reason for this is that</text><text start="65.878" dur="4.203">we&amp;#39;ve invested a huge amount
in nuclear deterrents.</text><text start="70.081" dur="5.098">But we&amp;#39;ve actually invested very little 
in a system to stop an epidemic.</text><text start="76.129" dur="2.964">We&amp;#39;re not ready for the next epidemic.</text><text start="80.023" dur="1.735">Let&amp;#39;s look at Ebola.</text><text start="81.758" dur="3.857">I&amp;#39;m sure all of you read about it 
in the newspaper,</text><text start="85.615" dur="1.606">lots of tough challenges.</text><text start="87.221" dur="3.655">I followed it carefully 
through the case analysis tools</text><text start="90.876" dur="4.845">we use to track polio eradication.</text><text start="95.721" dur="1.852">And as you look at what went on,</text><text start="97.573" dur="4.508">the problem wasn&amp;#39;t that there was a system
that didn&amp;#39;t work well enough,</text><text start="102.081" dur="3.568">the problem was that we 
didn&amp;#39;t have a system at all.</text><text start="106.589" dur="4.439">In fact, there&amp;#39;s some pretty obvious
key missing pieces.</text><text start="111.028" dur="4.912">We didn&amp;#39;t have a group of epidemiologists 
ready to go, who would have gone,</text><text start="115.94" dur="3.756">seen what the disease was,
seen how far it had spread.</text><text start="119.696" dur="2.756">The case reports came in on paper.</text><text start="122.452" dur="2.356">It was very delayed
before they were put online</text><text start="124.808" dur="1.974">and they were extremely inaccurate.</text><text start="127.492" dur="2.366">We didn&amp;#39;t have a medical team ready to go.</text><text start="129.858" dur="2.595">We didn&amp;#39;t have a way of preparing people.</text><text start="132.453" dur="5.331">Now, Médecins Sans Frontières 
did a great job orchestrating volunteers.</text><text start="137.784" dur="3.096">But even so, we were far slower
than we should have been</text><text start="140.88" dur="3.142">getting the thousands of workers
into these countries.</text><text start="144.022" dur="6.985">And a large epidemic would require us
to have hundreds of thousands of workers.</text><text start="152.752" dur="4.403">There was no one there 
to look at treatment approaches.</text><text start="157.155" dur="1.791">No one to look at the diagnostics.</text><text start="158.946" dur="3.297">No one to figure out 
what tools should be used.</text><text start="162.243" dur="3.48">As an example, we could have 
taken the blood of survivors,</text><text start="165.723" dur="5.435">processed it, and put that plasma
back in people to protect them.</text><text start="171.158" dur="2.606">But that was never tried.</text><text start="173.764" dur="1.756">So there was a lot that was missing.</text><text start="175.52" dur="3.895">And these things 
are really a global failure.</text><text start="180.305" dur="5.568">The WHO is funded to monitor epidemics,
but not to do these things I talked about.</text><text start="187.049" dur="2.793">Now, in the movies it&amp;#39;s quite different.</text><text start="189.842" dur="4.832">There&amp;#39;s a group of handsome
epidemiologists ready to go,</text><text start="194.674" dur="5.772">they move in, they save the day,
but that&amp;#39;s just pure Hollywood.</text><text start="202.177" dur="3.71">The failure to prepare 
could allow the next epidemic</text><text start="205.887" dur="3.808">to be dramatically 
more devastating than Ebola</text><text start="210.735" dur="4.796">Let&amp;#39;s look at the progression 
of Ebola over this year.</text><text start="216.311" dur="2.838">About 10,000 people died, </text><text start="219.149" dur="4.697">and nearly all were in the three
West African countries.</text><text start="223.846" dur="2.587">There&amp;#39;s three reasons why
it didn&amp;#39;t spread more.</text><text start="226.433" dur="4.441">The first is that there was a lot 
of heroic work by the health workers.</text><text start="230.874" dur="3.262">They found the people and they 
prevented more infections.</text><text start="234.136" dur="2.485">The second is the nature of the virus.</text><text start="236.621" dur="3.076">Ebola does not spread through the air.</text><text start="239.697" dur="2.113">And by the time you&amp;#39;re contagious,</text><text start="241.81" dur="2.74">most people are so sick 
that they&amp;#39;re bedridden.</text><text start="246.22" dur="4.191">Third, it didn&amp;#39;t get
into many urban areas.</text><text start="250.411" dur="1.704">And that was just luck.</text><text start="252.115" dur="2.24">If it had gotten into a lot 
more urban areas,</text><text start="254.355" dur="3.522">the case numbers 
would have been much larger.</text><text start="257.877" dur="3.589">So next time, we might not be so lucky.</text><text start="261.466" dur="5.064">You can have a virus where people 
feel well enough while they&amp;#39;re infectious</text><text start="266.53" dur="3.312">that they get on a plane
or they go to a market.</text><text start="269.842" dur="3.004">The source of the virus could be 
a natural epidemic like Ebola,</text><text start="272.846" dur="1.98">or it could be bioterrorism.</text><text start="274.826" dur="4.648">So there are things that would literally
make things a thousand times worse.</text><text start="279.474" dur="6.001">In fact, let&amp;#39;s look at a model
of a virus spread through the air,</text><text start="285.475" dur="3.595">like the Spanish Flu back in 1918.</text><text start="289.63" dur="1.93">So here&amp;#39;s what would happen:</text><text start="291.56" dur="3.998">It would spread throughout the world
very, very quickly.</text><text start="295.558" dur="5.125">And you can see over 30 million people
died from that epidemic.</text><text start="300.683" dur="1.813">So this is a serious problem.</text><text start="302.496" dur="1.761">We should be concerned.</text><text start="304.257" dur="4.435">But in fact, we can build
a really good response system.</text><text start="308.692" dur="5.144">We have the benefits of all the science
and technology that we talk about here.</text><text start="313.836" dur="1.047">We&amp;#39;ve got cell phones</text><text start="314.883" dur="3.257">to get information from the public 
and get information out to them.</text><text start="318.14" dur="4.179">We have satellite maps where we can see
where people are and where they&amp;#39;re moving.</text><text start="322.319" dur="2.308">We have advances in biology</text><text start="324.627" dur="3.826">that should dramatically change 
the turnaround time to look at a pathogen</text><text start="328.453" dur="4.869">and be able to make drugs and vaccines
that fit for that pathogen.</text><text start="333.322" dur="1.566">So we can have tools,</text><text start="334.888" dur="4.612">but those tools need to be put
into an overall global health system.</text><text start="339.5" dur="2.293">And we need preparedness.</text><text start="341.793" dur="2.464">The best lessons, I think, 
on how to get prepared</text><text start="344.257" dur="2.501">are again, what we do for war.</text><text start="346.758" dur="4.247">For soldiers, we have full-time,
waiting to go.</text><text start="351.005" dur="3.311">We have reserves that can scale 
us up to large numbers.</text><text start="354.316" dur="3.689">NATO has a mobile unit 
that can deploy very rapidly.</text><text start="358.005" dur="3.45">NATO does a lot of war games 
to check, are people well trained?</text><text start="361.455" dur="2.428">Do they understand 
about fuel and logistics</text><text start="363.883" dur="2.358">and the same radio frequencies?</text><text start="366.241" dur="2.538">So they are absolutely ready to go.</text><text start="368.779" dur="4.355">So those are the kinds of things
we need to deal with an epidemic.</text><text start="373.134" dur="2.167">What are the key pieces?</text><text start="375.301" dur="5.29">First, we need strong health systems
in poor countries.</text><text start="380.591" dur="3.187">That&amp;#39;s where mothers 
can give birth safely,</text><text start="383.778" dur="1.517">kids can get all their vaccines.</text><text start="385.295" dur="4.339">But, also where we&amp;#39;ll see 
the outbreak very early on.</text><text start="390.154" dur="1.781">We need a medical reserve corps:</text><text start="391.935" dur="2.566">lots of people who&amp;#39;ve got 
the training and background</text><text start="394.501" dur="3.352">who are ready to go, with the expertise.</text><text start="397.853" dur="4.413">And then we need to pair those
medical people with the military.</text><text start="402.266" dur="4.151">taking advantage of the military&amp;#39;s ability
to move fast, do logistics</text><text start="406.417" dur="1.803">and secure areas.</text><text start="408.22" dur="2.909">We need to do simulations,</text><text start="411.129" dur="4.798">germ games, not war games,
so that we see where the holes are.</text><text start="415.927" dur="2.796">The last time a germ game 
was done in the United States</text><text start="418.723" dur="3.72">was back in 2001, 
and it didn&amp;#39;t go so well.</text><text start="422.453" dur="5.037">So far the score is germs: 1, people: 0.</text><text start="427.49" dur="6.119">Finally, we need lots of advanced R&amp;amp;D
in areas of vaccines and diagnostics.</text><text start="433.609" dur="3.637">There are some big breakthroughs, 
like the Adeno-associated virus,</text><text start="437.246" dur="3.983">that could work very, very quickly.</text><text start="441.229" dur="3.37">Now I don&amp;#39;t have an exact budget
for what this would cost,</text><text start="444.599" dur="4.496">but I&amp;#39;m quite sure it&amp;#39;s very modest
compared to the potential harm.</text><text start="449.095" dur="4.645">The World Bank estimates that 
if we have a worldwide flu epidemic,</text><text start="453.74" dur="3.725">global wealth will go down
by over three trillion dollars</text><text start="457.465" dur="3.867">and we&amp;#39;d have millions
and millions of deaths.</text><text start="461.332" dur="2.985">These investments 
offer significant benefits</text><text start="464.317" dur="2.201">beyond just being ready for the epidemic.</text><text start="466.518" dur="2.464">The primary healthcare, the R&amp;amp;D,</text><text start="468.982" dur="2.83">those things would reduce 
global health equity</text><text start="471.812" dur="3.69">and make the world more just 
as well as more safe.</text><text start="475.502" dur="3.362">So I think this should absolutely
be a priority.</text><text start="479.514" dur="1.466">There&amp;#39;s no need to panic.</text><text start="480.98" dur="4.489">We don&amp;#39;t have to hoard cans of spaghetti
or go down into the basement.</text><text start="485.469" dur="3.84">But we need to get going,
because time is not on our side.</text><text start="489.309" dur="6.215">In fact, if there&amp;#39;s one positive thing
that can come out of the Ebola epidemic,</text><text start="495.524" dur="5.806">it&amp;#39;s that it can serve as an early 
warning, a wake-up call, to get ready.</text><text start="501.33" dur="5.648">If we start now, we can be ready 
for the next epidemic.</text><text start="506.978" dur="1.596">Thank you.</text><text start="508.574" dur="3.294">(Applause)</text></transcript>
